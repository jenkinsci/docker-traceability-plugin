  By default, the plugin registers traceability reports for images, which have
  fingerprints registered by Jenkins plugins using the functionality from 
  <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Commons+Plugin">
    Docker Commons Plugin</a>. 
    This behavior may may be an obstacle if a you want to trace fingerprints
  for images created outside Jenkins or by plugins, which have no integration with
  <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Commons+Plugin">
    Docker Commons</a>.
  <p/>
  If enabled, Docker Traceability plugin will create image fingerprints for <b>all</b>
  submitted reports, hence the plugin starts tracking containers being
  created for images without parent image fingerprints.
